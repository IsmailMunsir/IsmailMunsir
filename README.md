## 🧠 About Me

I am a BSc (Hons) Software Engineering undergraduate at Cardiff Metropolitan University with strong interests in cloud computing, system administration, and scalable application development. 

I enjoy building full-stack applications, managing databases, working with virtualization environments, and designing practical solutions that solve real-world problems. My goal is to grow into a cloud and infrastructure-focused engineering role while continuously strengthening my foundations in systems, networking, and security.
